## Welcome to Snoot Suit Snuggle!

*Our mission is to empower people to be able to snooze and rest their eyes in all situations and places.  In this society, we have a habit of getting less and less sleep, and still complain about it. This invention counteracts peoples ability to contribute and improve our world, due to lack of proper rest.*

The Snoot Suit Snuggle is a creation that will enable you to sleep anywhere and anytime, so you are better rested and therefore more productive and happy. We are combatting stress and weariness, to give **you** an opportunity to seize the day! <br> <br>
> Because continuity matters, and so do your sleeping habits. <br> <br>
